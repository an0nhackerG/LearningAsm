# Why Learn Assembly?
Assembly language offers a deep understanding of how processors and systems operate. This repository aims to assist those on their journey to mastering Assembly by providing a collection of my own files and projects.

# Contribute to This Repository
If you wish to share your code, you're more than welcome! Just make sure to include a comment in your code that links back to your GitHub profile or any other identifier. However, there are some guidelines to follow:

# Guidelines for Contribution
- **Commenting**: Each function should have at least one well-explained comment. Feel free to add more comments, but don't go overboard.

- **Ownership**: The main file should primarily be your own work. You may include open-source code as part of your project, but make sure to adhere to the original creator's license terms.

- **Licensing**: All files should comply with this repository's license. If your file has a different license (e.g., GNU), it must be explicitly stated at the top of the file.

- **Identification**: Include a comment at the top of the file to indicate that the file belongs to you.

- **File Structure**: Follow this hierarchy for file placement:
  LearningAsm/your_identifier/assembler/architecture/...

- **Language Compatibility**: You can share projects that are Assembly-only or those that combine Assembly with C or Rust.
